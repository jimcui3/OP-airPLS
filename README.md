# OP-airPLS

This repository is for OP-airPLS, an adaptive grid search optimization algorithm to find best parameters for the airPLS baseline removal.

It contains sample data used in the experiments, and demonstrations of using Jupyter notebooks files to run the optimization algorithm. 

## Requirements

The code in this repo has been tested with the following software versions:
- Python 3.7.0
- Scikit-Learn 0.20.0
- Numpy 1.15.1
- Seaborn 0.9.0
- Matplotlib 3.0.0

We recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution, which is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Installation for all required packages (listed above) has been tested using the standard instructions from the providers of each package. 

## Data

The sample data for the experiments can be found and downloaded in the `data` subdirectory.

## Running the notebooks

Experiments reported in the notebooks were achieved using a Laptop with Windows 11, Intel i7-10875H CPU (2.30GHz) and 32 GB RAM. If you find any bugs or have questions, please contact `jiaheng.cui@uga.edu` or `zhao-nano-lab@uga.edu`.
